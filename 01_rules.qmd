Joining Coding Club is easy, but our members also follow some simple (and straightforward) rules:

# Rule 1
Be nice. Be respectful. Be inclusive. :busts_in_silhouette:

# Rule 2
We'll all learn from each other. It's a give and take. :handshake:

# Rule 3
We are **not** required to host workshops. There are better resources for these, and we would gladly point you to these resources if needed. :notebook_with_decorative_cover:


Coding club is just as good as its members. So if you like what Coding Club is doing, support the club by participating in meet-ups and events and being more active.
