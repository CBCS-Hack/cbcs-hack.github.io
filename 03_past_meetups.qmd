CBCS Coding Club meet-ups are led by different folks of different coding backgrounds and career levels. Topics are broad and encompass different programming languages (R, python), coding skills (spatial data analysis and visualization, data wrangling, writing shiny apps), and coding tools (VS Code, HPC). 

If you're interested in leading a meet-up, feel free to contact any of the current Coding Club co-leads!
