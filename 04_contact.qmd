We are an inclusive bunch, so to be part of the growing CBCS Coding Club community, all you need to do is ask and email the [Current Co-leads](00_about.qmd) to be added.

For any questions regarding the [Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science](https://cbcs.centre.uq.edu.au/), email our Centre Coordinator, Kate Donnelly at [cbcs-admin@uq.edu.au](mailto:cbcs-admin@uq.edu.au).
