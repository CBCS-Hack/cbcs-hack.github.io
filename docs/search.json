While she enjoys coding all-day, working to develop reproducible tools and frameworks used to facilitate the uptake of climate-smart approaches in on-the-ground, applied conservation planning approaches, she wishes to continue navigating the science-policy interface, particularly in relation to the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement."
