While I enjoy coding all-day, working to develop reproducible tools and frameworks used to facilitate the uptake of climate-smart approaches in on-the-ground, applied conservation planning approaches, I wish to continue navigating the science-policy interface, particularly in relation to the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement. I love trying out so many different new hobbies, but only sticks to a couple, like reading sci-fi and fantasy books, watching basketball, playing video games."

Now I spend my days wrestling with massive datasets in R, creating visualizations that hopefully make sense, and investigating how international seafood trade impacts marine life. My PhD focuses on the sustainability of global seafood supply chains, particularly the trade of threatened species as seafood. When I‚Äôm not coding or untangling the complexities of fish economics, I‚Äôm dreaming up novel ways to make our seafood consumption more sustainable."

There are better resources for these, and we would gladly point you to these resources if needed. üìî\nCoding club is just as good as its members.
