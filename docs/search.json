I thoroughly enjoy coding all-day [(in the dark) with my feet up blasting Someone Like You by Adele in my headphones], working on developing reproducible tools and frameworks used to facilitate the uptake of climate-smart approaches in on-the-ground, applied conservation planning approaches. When I‚Äôm not knee-deep in coding, I am navigating the science-policy interface, particularly in relation to the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement, by engaging with key players and stakeholders in the process."

Now I spend my days wrestling with massive datasets in R, creating visualizations that hopefully make sense, and investigating how international seafood trade impacts marine life. My PhD focuses on the sustainability of global seafood supply chains, particularly the trade of threatened species as seafood. When I‚Äôm not coding or untangling the complexities of fish economics, I‚Äôm dreaming up novel ways to make our seafood consumption more sustainable."
